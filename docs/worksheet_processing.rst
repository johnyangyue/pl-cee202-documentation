Worksheet Processing
=====

Data Preparation
------------

Since worksheet grades are processed by group, we need a ``class_info.csv`` file with student names NetIDs, and team assignment.

Running the Script
------------

Once all relevant files are ready, we can run the script in the ``cee202_ws_process.ipynb`` file to obtain processed worksheet grades,
student attendance, and muddiest questions.
